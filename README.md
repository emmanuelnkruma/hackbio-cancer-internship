This is short essay about RNA Sequence in Data Science and Machine Learning. 
Hope you enjoy as you read :) 

RNA Seq is like taking a snapshot of all the active parts of a cell's genetic material at a given time. 
It tells us which genes are "on" and which are "off."
By using data science and machine learning, scientists can sift through this huge amount of data to find patterns that help us understand diseases like cancer.
For instance, they can figure out which genes are making cancer grow and which might be targets for new treatments. 
This technology is helping to create more personalized and effective therapies for cancer patients.
