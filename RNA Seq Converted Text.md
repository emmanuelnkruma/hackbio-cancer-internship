# Understanding RNA Seq

RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) is a technique for studying the transcriptome that involves collecting all RNA molecules in a cell or tissue. Unlike DNA, which is generally static, RNA changes dynamically in response to illness, stress, or therapy. By examining RNA, scientists can identify whether genes are active or quiet under particular settings..[<sup>1</sup>](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.27283v1)

# The Process of RNA Seq

The RNA Seq procedure begins with the extraction of RNA from a sample (such as cancer tissue). This RNA is transformed into complementary DNA (cDNA), which is more stable and simpler to sequence. The cDNA is broken down into small pieces and then sequenced to generate millions of short reads. These readings are then matched to a reference genome, and the quantity of RNA for each gene is determined. The outcome is a thorough map of the genes that are activated in the sample.


# Analyzing RNA Seq Data with Data Science

The complex data collected by RNAseq necessitates the use of data science. The objective is to make sense of the gene expression levels seen in various samples. For example, data scientists employ algorithms to identify trends and discrepancies in gene expression between healthy and malignant cells. This can help in discovering the genes implicated in cancer formation.


# Machine Learning in RNA Seq

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in which computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. RNA Seq uses machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on gene expression data. Researchers, for example, can use RNA Seq data to build a model that predicts whether a patient would react to a specific cancer treatment. The model learns from previous data and uses that knowledge to generate predictions about future patients. [<sup>2</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.04.007)


# Applications in Cancer Research

RNA sequencing has revolutionized cancer research. Scientists can discover genes responsible for cancer progression by comparing the RNA profiles of malignant and normal tissues. For example, certain genes in tumors may be hyperactive, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. RNA sequencing can potentially uncover new targets for cancer therapy or biomarkers that aid in early cancer detection.
